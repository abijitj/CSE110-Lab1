## Introduction
![profilepic](/profilepic.jpeg)

Hello! I'm a **second-year CE student** who is interesting in learning more about the software engineering process. Additionally, I am curious how AI will be a part of this class as it was hinted at in the syllabus and by the professor during lecture. 

>**Fun fact:** I grew up in 4 different countries (India, Malawi, Ethiopia, and Thailand). And now, I am studying in the US. 

## Programming Experience

I have some experience in the following programming languages: 
- [C++](https://cplusplus.com/)
- [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)
- [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)
- [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#headings)

Some other tools I have used also include `gdb`, `valgrind`, `vim`, 


## What I currently expect SE to be

I believe the following characteristics are (some) very important in a good software engineer: 

1. Teamwork
2. Coding Ability
3. Design 

However, I am very curious how AI technologies will affect these characteristics. ChatGPT, Github CoPilot, and other similar technologies have dramatically sped up code generation. So point #2 has already seen some change. I wonder how design and teamwork will be affected in the future as AI continues to improve. 

## Goals for CSE110
Here are some goals or learning outcomes I have for CSE 110. I will (try) check these off as the quarter progresses.

- [ ] Learn more about the SE process and hopefully learn more about the industry in the process. 
- [ ] Improve collaboration skills
- [ ] Learn `Javascript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`
- [ ] Improve `git` and GitHub knowledge
